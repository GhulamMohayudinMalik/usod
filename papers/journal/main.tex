\begin{abstract}
Modern cybersecurity operations face unprecedented challenges due to the proliferation of heterogeneous platforms (web, desktop, mobile), sophisticated attack vectors, and the growing complexity of threat detection across application and network layers. Traditional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions typically focus on single-platform deployment and rely heavily on signature-based detection, limiting their effectiveness against novel attacks and creating operational fragmentation. This paper presents USOD (Unified Security Operations Dashboard), a comprehensive security operations platform that addresses these challenges through unified multi-platform architecture and hybrid threat detection combining pattern-based and machine learning approaches. The system implements consistent security operations across web (Next.js 15/React 19), desktop (Electron 38), and mobile (React Native/Expo 54) platforms, all integrated with a centralized Node.js Express 5 backend and MongoDB database. USOD features application-layer pattern-based detection for 12 attack types with automatic IP blocking, complemented by network-layer ML-based detection using Random Forest (99.97\% accuracy on CICIDS2017) and Isolation Forest (87.33\% accuracy) models implemented via Python FastAPI service. Real-time threat distribution across platforms utilizes Server-Sent Events (SSE) achieving sub-100ms latency. The system includes an interactive security testing laboratory for educational purposes, comprehensive logging of 30 event types, and complete architectural designs for future blockchain integration (Hyperledger Fabric) and cloud automation (Terraform/Ansible). Extensive evaluation demonstrates sub-200ms average response times, successful cross-platform deployment, practical ML integration patterns, and significant educational value. This work contributes validated performance metrics for ML-based intrusion detection on CICIDS2017, demonstrates practical multi-platform security operations architecture, and provides honest assessment of current capabilities versus future enhancements needed for enterprise production deployment.
